                    After obtaining a high school diploma, Victoria attended Virginia Tech and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Development. Human Development is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses the study of different stages of life, from birth to older adulthood. It takes a closer look at the processes of growth and change that occur across individuals' lifespans, in addition to the study of individuals and families from a multidisciplinary perspective.

                    Without dismay, Victoria was able to register as a student for Grand Circus's C# coding bootcamp, where she is able to pursue a long-time interest.
